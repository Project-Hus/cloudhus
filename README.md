build a LSTM model, which predicts squat, benchpress, deadlift strength according to the performed workout program and various environmental variables.
using this model, we provide the web service which suggests workout program that is expected to make best outcome.

we also provide routine management service to help users manage their training and based on this management service, we gather further training data.
